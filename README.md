# Flyback Transformer Arc Generator

This project is a MOSFET-switched flyback transformer system designed to generate high-voltage arcs from a low-voltage DC power source. A battery supply is rapidly switched through the flyback primary using an NMOS transistor, creating high-voltage output capable of sustaining an air-gap arc.

The system uses:
- 7.4V battery source (2 series 21700 50E batteries)
- Fast-blow fuse for input protection
- Push-button switch for manual enable
- Zener diode gate protection
- NMOS transistor for switching
- Snubber and timing capacitors
- Packaged flyback transformer
- Spark gap as the load
